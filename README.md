# IrisFlowersNeuralNetwork
Used a custom two-layer Neural Network and Matrix class to create a model that classifies flowers based on the Iris flowers dataset. 

Flowers were classified between 'Iris Virginica', 'Iris Versicolor', and 'Iris Setosa'. Features used are the Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
Tested the trained model using separated test data. Test data would be plotted using matplotlib using Petal Length and Petal Width as X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub>. 

| Class | Color |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Iris Virginica  | Red  |
| Iris Versicolor  | Blue  |
| Iris Setosa  | Green  |
